Working Title: "Eric's Amazing Square Popping Game"

#Landing Page

Game starts with a display that is about 500px high and 600px wide. In the display is a square that is changing random colors and says "Click Square to Play" in the middle.

#Initialization

When the player clicks that square will shrink down and start moving randomly around the screen - it is still flashing colors. The display is still the same size of 500px x 600px.

#Game play

A timer will count down from 42 seconds - as thats my wife's favorite number.

When the player clicks on a block: 
	MVP --> - 100 points will be added to their score.
	
	- The block will 'break' into two new blocks - original block is removed and 2 new blocks spawn.


This process will repeat over and over until the timer reaches zero.

The game will end and the players score will appear on the screen.

It will ask  "Would like to play again?"
they can click yes to replay or it will just stay on the screen with their score.

BONUS
If I can complete this with any time to spare, I would like to add the following features:
	- With 15 seconds left introduce a faster, smaller block worth 1000 points. This doesn't break into two but sets another smaller block that moves faster to spawn. 
	- Every missed click player looses 50 points.


I'm not sure right now about any music or sound effects.






# Game proposals

Tonight please write a paragraph or two outlining your game idea. You don't have to go into tons of detail but make it specific enough that you feel comfortable pitching it.

### some things that might help guide your thinking:
- *Landing page:* What will a player see when they start your game?
- *Initialization:* What will a player see when the game is started?
- *Game play:* What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expeted to do and what will the user expect from the game?
- *Win condition:* What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?
- *Reset:* How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.
